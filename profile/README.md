## About

Poisson was a prototype from 2009-2010, for what eventually became [Transformice](https://transformice.com). Which was very successful and is still active today.

From the [Atelier 801 Wiki](https://atelier801.fandom.com/wiki/Poisson):
> **Poisson** (French for "**Fish**") was a predecessor to [Aaaah!](https://atelier801.fandom.com/wiki/Aaaah!) posted on [Extinction](https://atelier801.fandom.com/wiki/Extinction), with mechanics similar to [Transformice](https://atelier801.fandom.com/wiki/Transformice) in terms of gameplay and objects. It was only online for a few months until Transformice was released. Instead of mice looking for cheese, in Poisson there were fish trying to get back into a water bowl.

## Why?
Poisson was lost for 10 years, and there are alot of people who want to play it today. The latest Gameplay footage we have of Poisson on YouTube is from 2011. And i saw that there are alot of people who want to play it. (Both on the Atelier 801 Forums and even on the Transformice chat sometimes!)

## Will you release the source code?
#### TL;DR: Not at the moment.
We know that there are alot of clout chasers on the TFM community who puts malware, no credits, and alot of shit on standalone clients, pirated servers and alot more.
We do plan to release the source code as soon as we get recognition.
No one else on the internet, not even the developers themselves, have the source code for this, and we know people will try to steal it.

### How did you find this?
In Late-2021, Taikohhh and RaySollium99 started a hunt for this, and we eventually found a bunch of SWF server packs on dead archived websites, and we just combined everything (Server, Client, etc) and tweaked some stuff to make a working Poisson Server.

After a year of searching for these, we managed to make a working Poisson server
